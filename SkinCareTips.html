		 	<h1>Steps On How To Take Care Of YOUR Skin</h1>

		 	<h1>Follow these steps to gaurentee, healthy, moisturized, and clean skin!</h1>

		 	<p>The first step to having healthy skin is to wash it daily, morning and night. Some people double cleanse, which involves using an oil-based cleanser first to remove makeup, sunscreen, and excess oil, followed by a water-based cleanser to thoroughly clean the skin. After cleansing, itâ€™s important to follow a complete skincare routine to maintain a balanced, glowing complexion.
		 	</p>

		 	<p2>Toner: After cleansing, apply toner to help remove any leftover impurities, balance the skin's pH, and prep it for the next steps. Toners can also hydrate and refresh the skin.</p2>

		<p3>Exfoliating (2-3 times a week): Exfoliating helps to remove dead skin cells, allowing for a smoother texture and more even tone. Use a gentle exfoliator to avoid irritation, and be careful not to overdo it, as too much exfoliation can strip the skin's natural barrier.
		</p3>

		<p4>Serums or Oils: Next, apply any treatment products, like serums or oils. Serums are packed with active ingredients like Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, or retinol that target specific skin concerns such as hydration, anti-aging, or brightening. Oils, on the other hand, help seal in moisture and nourish the skin.</p4>

		<p5>Moisturizer: After your treatment products, apply a moisturizer to hydrate and lock in all the previous layers. Moisturizers come in different textures for various skin types, so choose one that suits your needs, whether lightweight for oily skin or richer for dry skin.</p5>

		<p6>Sunscreen (morning only): As the final step in your morning routine, apply sunscreen with at least SPF 30. Sunscreen is crucial for protecting the skin from harmful UV rays, which can cause premature aging, hyperpigmentation, and skin damage.</p6>

		<p7>Following these steps consistently can help promote clear, healthy, and radiant skin.</p7>
